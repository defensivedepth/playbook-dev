name: GPL RPC portmap NFS request TCP
id: 22101960
description: |
  This alert detects RPC portmap requests for NFS services on TCP port 111. The RPC portmapper (rpcbind)
  is used to map RPC program numbers to network port numbers, and NFS clients query it to discover NFS
  service endpoints. Organizations commonly use NFS for network file sharing in Unix/Linux environments.
  External RPC portmap queries may indicate legitimate access attempts, network mapping, or reconnaissance
  activity. Investigation should determine if the source is authorized and if the NFS exposure is intended.
