name: HackTool - SecurityXploded Execution
id: 1500062
description: |
  Detects the execution of SecurityXploded password recovery and security tools, which include password dumping utilities for browsers, email clients, instant messengers, wireless networks, and Windows credentials. While SecurityXploded tools are marketed as legitimate password recovery utilities, they are frequently used in APT campaigns and credential theft operations. Notable examples include usage in the Gangnam Industrial Style APT campaign targeting Korean industrial companies, where SecurityXploded tools were combined with spear phishing emails and the Separ credential stealing malware to exfiltrate browser credentials, email passwords, and industrial documents.
